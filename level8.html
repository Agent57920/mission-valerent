<div class="txt">Scene: Cafeteria</div>
<div class="txt">The bell rang, and students rushed toward the cafeteria in a chaotic wave of noise and laughter.</div>
<div class="txt">Avron did not rush.</div>
<div class="txt">He walked slowly from table to table, scanning for a seat. It wasn’t that the cafeteria was full. In fact, it was emptier than usual.</div>
<div class="txt">But every time he approached an empty seat, someone would casually spit on it or wipe it with a dirty napkin, making it unusable.</div>
<div class="txt">No one wanted to sit with Avron.</div>
<div class="txt">Avron had Progeria. His physical appearance made him an easy target. Students avoided him. Some mocked him. Others simply pretended he didn’t exist.</div>
<div class="txt">Even teachers ignored him.</div>

        <div class="txt">Whenever he raised his hand in class, their eyes passed over him. They called on someone else. If he won a prize in a competition, his name was often replaced with another student’s name on the final announcement. He had been denied more than twenty awards he rightfully earned.</div>
        <div class="txt">He never protested.</div>
        <div class="txt">He was too shy to question authority. And since no one else cared, the pattern continued.</div>
        <div class="txt">Once, he had been selected to participate in a school sports event. It was his first time being part of something public. He arrived excited that morning — only to find his name replaced by a student close to the principal.</div>
        <div class="txt">That was the day he stopped expecting fairness.</div>
        <div class="txt">Years passed.</div>
        <div class="txt">Eventually, he became the head editor of the school newspaper — not because his talent was recognized, but because no one else wanted the position. Students believed the newspaper club was for “losers.”</div>

<div class="txt">Avron accepted it quietly.</div>
<div class="txt">It was something.</div>
<div class="txt">Time: Valentine’s Week</div>
<div class="txt">On February 7th, Rose Day, Avron was assigned to design a special edition of the newspaper.</div>
<div class="txt">He turned it into a puzzle.</div>
<div class="txt">He hid repeated words inside an article and pinned it to the school notice board.</div>
<div class="txt">He did not expect anyone to read it.</div>
<div class="txt">No one ever did.</div>
<div class="txt">But that day, a girl stopped.</div>
<div class="txt">She read every line carefully.</div>
<butron id="sub3">Next</butron>
</div>
</div>


<div id="overlay4">
    <div id="modal4">
<div class="txt">Then she circled the repeated words — every single “rose” — and beneath them she wrote:</div>
<div class="txt">“Make it a little harder next time. – Tanice.”</div>
<div class="txt">Avron stood at a distance, stunned.</div>
<div class="txt">When he approached the board, his heart raced.</div>
<div class="txt">She had solved it.</div>
<div class="txt">That night, he searched the school records for her name.</div>
<div class="txt">He found everything he could — class, section, academic record.</div>
<div class="txt">He debated all night whether he should approach her.</div>
<div class="txt">The next day at lunch, nervous but determined, he walked up to her.</div>
<div class="txt">“H–Hi.”</div>

        <div class="txt">“Oh. The puzzle guy.”</div>
        <div class="txt">He almost smiled.</div>
        <div class="txt">“Yes. The puzzle guy.”</div>
        <div class="txt">“It was good,” she said. “But you can do better.”</div>
        <div class="txt">The bell rang.</div>
        <div class="txt">“I have to go,” she said. “Meet me at Downtown Café tomorrow after school?”</div>
        <div class="txt">She handed him a page with her number written on the back.</div>
        <div class="txt">For the first time in his life, Avron felt noticed.</div>

        <div class="txt">“One of them has a golden ticket. Find it.”</div>
        <div class="txt">Tanice found the box in her locker.</div>
        <div class="txt">She took it to the restroom.</div>

        <div class="txt">The one with the golden ticket.</div>

        <div class="txt">At the café, Avron asked how she solved it.</div>
        <div class="txt">She explained calmly that most chocolates would float in water due to density, but the one with the ticket would sink because of extra weight.</div>
        <div class="txt">He didn’t hear a word.</div>
        <div class="txt">He was too busy staring at her.</div>
        <div class="txt">Time: After Six Months</div>

        <div class="txt">Real friends.</div>
        <div class="txt">They went to cafés, arcades, malls, parks.</div>
        <div class="txt">She teased him. He laughed more.</div>
        <div class="txt">For the first time, he had someone to sit with during lunch.</div>
        <div class="txt">Teachers stopped skipping his hand. Students stopped mocking him openly.</div>
        <div class="txt">Not because they changed.</div>
        <div class="txt">But because he was no longer alone.</div>

        <div class="txt">But that night, he couldn’t sleep.</div>
        <div class="txt">He saw a couple’s shadow outside his window — hugging.</div>
        <div class="txt">The power of that hug was so strong that every problem of the world was very weak in front of that</div>
        <div class="txt">He realized what he felt.</div>
